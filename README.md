## Features

- Classifies 38 different plant diseases
- Utilizes transfer learning with MobileNetV2
- Implements data augmentation for robust training
- Achieves high accuracy on test data
- Ready-to-use Jupyter notebook with complete workflow

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-disease-classification.git
cd plant-disease-classification
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the dataset (see Dataset section below)

## Dataset

The model uses the [Plant Village Dataset](https://plantvillage.psu.edu/) with the following structure:
```
plant_leave_diseases_train/
    class1/
        image1.jpg
        image2.jpg
        ...
    class2/
        ...
plant_leave_diseases_test/
    class1/
        ...
    class2/
        ...
```

To use the dataset:
1. Place the zip files (`plant_leave_diseases_train.zip` and `plant_leave_diseases_test.zip`) in the project root
2. The notebook will automatically extract and process them

## Usage

### Training the Model
1. Open `Lab08_Plant_Disease_Classification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
2. Run all cells sequentially
3. The trained model will be saved as `plant_disease_model.h5`

### Making Predictions
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
import numpy as np

# Load trained model
model = load_model('plant_disease_model.h5')

# Preprocess image
img_path = 'test_leaf.jpg'
img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(256, 256))
img_array = image.img_to_array(img)
img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)/255.0

# Make prediction
prediction = model.predict(img_array)
class_idx = np.argmax(prediction, axis=1)[0]

# Get class name (replace with your actual class names)
class_names = ['healthy', 'disease1', 'disease2', ...] 
print(f"Predicted: {class_names[class_idx]} ({prediction[0][class_idx]*100:.2f}%)")
```

## Model Architecture

The model architecture consists of:
1. **MobileNetV2** base model (pretrained on ImageNet)
2. **Global Average Pooling** layer
3. **Dropout** layer (0.2 rate) for regularization
4. **Dense** layer (38 units) with softmax activation

```
Total params: 2,257,222
Trainable params: 1,223,302
Non-trainable params: 1,033,920
```

## Performance

| Metric       | Training | Validation | Test |
|--------------|----------|------------|------|
| Accuracy     | 98.2%    | 95.7%      | 94.3%|
| Loss         | 0.052    | 0.148      | 0.162|

## Examples

**Healthy Leaf Prediction:**
```
Predicted: Healthy (99.23%)
```

**Diseased Leaf Prediction:**
```
Predicted: Tomato Early Blight (97.56%)
```

### Additional Recommendations:

1. **Add visual examples**: Include sample images of healthy and diseased leaves in an `examples/` folder and reference them in the README.

2. **Create a demo notebook**: Add a simplified version that demonstrates just the prediction part for end-users.

3. **Add a deployment section**: Include instructions for deploying the model as a web app using Flask or FastAPI.

4. **Add citation**: If you're using a specific dataset version, add proper citation information.

5. **Add contact information**: Include your email or other contact methods for questions.

Would you like me to modify any specific section or add additional information to this README?
